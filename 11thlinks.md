1. Mathematics

The entire foundation of Class 12 Calculus (Limits, Differentiation, Integration) and higher-level Coordinate Geometry relies heavily on Class 11 Algebra and Trigonometry.
Class 12 Topic	Essential Class 11 Concepts Required
Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability (Calculus)	Functions: Domain, Range, Graphing of elementary functions (polynomial, rational, modulus, exponential, logarithmic), Algebra of functions.
	Trigonometry: All fundamental Trigonometric Identities (especially double/triple angle and sum/difference formulas) are crucial for solving limit and differentiation problems.
Integral Calculus (Indefinite & Definite Integration)	Trigonometric Identities: Essential for integration by substitution and partial fractions.
	Quadratic Equations & Inequalities: Required for solving definite integrals involving algebraic functions.
3D Geometry & Vector Algebra	Vector Algebra (Basic 11th Physics concepts): Vector addition, subtraction, and resolution of vectors into components.
	2D Coordinate Geometry (Straight Lines & Conic Sections): The distance formula, section formula, and the concept of direction cosines/ratios are extended from 2D to 3D.
Probability	Permutations and Combinations (P&C): Used for calculating the total number of outcomes and favorable outcomes.
	Sets, Relations, and Functions: Fundamental understanding of set operations (Union, Intersection, Complement) is the basis of probability theorems.
Matrices and Determinants (Solution of Linear Equations)	Quadratic Equations: Used in finding eigenvalues or solving for variables.

2. Physics

Class 11 Mechanics provides the framework, and Class 12 uses mathematical tools and concepts from it (like vectors and conservation laws) to describe Electric and Magnetic fields.
Class 12 Topic	Essential Class 11 Concepts Required
Electrostatics & Current Electricity	Vector Algebra: The backbone for Coulomb's Law, Electric Field, and Gauss's Law (vector nature of force and field).
	Work, Energy, and Power: The concept of Potential Energy (Gravitational Potential Energy) is directly applied and extended to Electric Potential Energy and Electric Potential.
	Kinematics & Laws of Motion (LOM): Concepts of force, acceleration, and equations of motion are used in solving problems of charged particles moving in electric/magnetic fields.
Magnetic Effects of Current & Magnetism	Rotational Motion: The concept of Torque (τ=r×F) is applied to magnetic dipoles in a uniform magnetic field.
	Circular Motion: The expression for Centripetal Force (rmv2​) is used to determine the path of a charge moving perpendicular to a magnetic field.
Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)	Differentiation (from Class 12 Maths): Faraday's Law, e=−dtdϕB​​, requires a strong understanding of differentiation.
Thermodynamics (in Chemistry & Physics)	Thermodynamics (Chapter in 11th): First Law (ΔU=Q−W) and the concepts of Isothermal, Adiabatic, Isobaric, and Isochoric processes are directly used in Physical Chemistry.
Optics	Basic Trigonometry & Geometry: Used for ray tracing, applying Snell's law, and determining focal lengths/magnification.

3. Chemistry

A weak Class 11 foundation in Physical and Organic Chemistry will make over 60% of the Class 12 syllabus extremely challenging.
Class 12 Topic	Essential Class 11 Concepts Required
Solutions, Electrochemistry, Chemical Kinetics	Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry (Mole Concept): Absolutely critical. You must be fast and accurate with molarity, molality, mole fraction, mass percent, and stoichiometry calculations.
	Thermodynamics: Understanding Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG), Enthalpy (ΔH), and Entropy (ΔS) is essential for Electrochemistry (Nernst Equation and cell potential) and Chemical Kinetics (Activation Energy, Arrhenius Equation).
	Chemical Equilibrium & Ionic Equilibrium: Understanding equilibrium constants (Kc​,Kp​), Le Chatelier’s Principle, and the concept of pH is essential for both solutions and electrochemistry.
Coordination Compounds, D- and F-Block Elements	Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure: The concepts of Hybridization (sp,sp2,sp3,dsp2, etc.), VSEPR Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory are the basis for understanding the structure and properties of coordination compounds.
	Atomic Structure & Periodicity: Understanding orbital shapes, electron configuration, and periodic trends (ionization enthalpy, electronegativity, atomic radius) is necessary for all Inorganic Chemistry chapters.
Organic Chemistry (Haloalkanes, Alcohols, Aldehydes, etc.)	General Organic Chemistry (GOC): This is the single most important prerequisite. You must master:
	
	
	
	
	Hydrocarbons: Basic reactions and properties of Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes are the starting points for substitution and addition reactions in Class 12.
